That's all we expect! We really believe that you shouldn't be a slave to your work, and that you should have great energy at work - we expect your best when you're here - and then when you're done - log off, go for a walk, a nap, be with your family, your friends, your dog, whatever - and don't worry about the office. Don't look at or answer emails or Slack after hours or on weekends - we got you! Turn off, enjoy! \nAnd that attitude flows over to COVID when we knew we just wanted to worry about our people, their families, and our customers. We know that if our people are good, our customers will be good. \nThat's why we continue to work from home, and are staying there until at least September 2022.  So many other things going on like summer break, back to school, etc., etc. - let's let this thing run its course and reassess next year.\nYes, we are absolutely customer-centric - wanting to make the border disappear for our customers so they can grow their business, in turn growing ours.\nWith regards to resources - yes we are on a hiring spree right now with a bunch of open positions as we are growing and want to keep pace with demand. Our systems have steadily been upgraded - new phone system (virtual), new email system, and we are working on our customs system next.\nThanks again for your review, I appreciate it.\nGB",

When the borders closed in March and trade dropped by 30%, we had to make some decisions that unfortunately impacted our people. \nOn the positive side, I'm glad to hear that the Pros are great coworkers, benefits, and our flexibility which are things we are proud of. Currently, we are all working from home still and hope to stay that way for a while.\nI would disagree that we don't care what our people have to say - we encourage feedback and we hold monthly meetings, quarterly updates (all hands) and put a lot of time &amp; effort into answering questions, asking questions, and learning how we can be better. One of our core values is #learnandgrow. \nI don't feel like I have \"yes men\" (or women) around me - in fact, most of our battles are because we DON'T agree and we love debating until we find what's best for our customers and our people. \nI do not use the word \"family\" to describe our culture or business. In fact, I don't really like the word to describe a company - I prefer \"Team\" like a sports team - another core value is #playasateam.  We are not a family, we are a team and sometimes, unfortunately, some players have to get traded or retired and that's something you can't do as a family. We are a team and are looking for great players in every position.\nIf you look at my previous responses to Reviews, I don't believe I usually say how wrong the negative review is. I like to address each issue, point by point, to let you know our position on that issue. You will have your opinion and we/I will have mine. \nWe had a very difficult 2020, and I can see you were impacted by that which I feel terrible for. The decisions we made in 2020 have led us to have a great start to 2021, the borders are currently stable, our business is growing, and we have a bright outlook. \nThank you,\nGB",

                "review_cons": "Where should I start... Avoid this company AT ALL COSTS!!\r\n\r\n1) The CEO is a privileged man who doesn't have a clue how to run a business, and refuses to listen to the people under him who actually do the jobs. Instead, he hires a bunch of executive staff with egos as big as his (who have ZERO industry experience) who will simply do whatever he wants. He got rid of truly talented team players that worked hard, who embodied the so called \"company culture\" and were helping to try and improve the company every time executive staff broke another piece of it.\r\n2) The executive staff has had all the negative reviews REMOVED from social media and recruitment platforms. This proves the unwillingness to except that A &amp; A is NOT a great place to work and that A &amp; A does not treat their staff right. But don't worry job hunters, I'm here to correct that for you now!\r\n3) They pay BELOW industry standards, do NOT give any raises unless you go above and beyond (meaning work yourself to death, take courses and prove you can utilize these new skills. But you'll have a probationary period and if they don't think you're ready yet, bye bye raise!) and if you make to much, they'll cut you loose. And if that doesn't deter you, then remember when you're struggling to pay your bills, that the Executives who boss you around yet don't even understand the industry are making 3 to 4 times what you are. \r\n4) They work the front line staff to their breaking point. The turnover rate at A &amp; A is ridiculous! I'm talking 60 people in 1 year... in a company of less than 100! They have hired over 50 people in a year and only approximately 10% are still there. The departments are ALL understaffed because they cannot hire and train fast enough to replace those who leave. Staff have gotten pushed so far past their breaking point they have walked out and just never came back. If you enjoy working unpaid overtime, not taking your unpaid lunch and working as fast as you possibly can, for it to never be enough, then hey, maybe A &amp; A is perfect for you.\r\n5) They preach growth, yet put up roadblock after roadblock. Oh, and you might get hired for a certain role, but don't get to attached, because they will decide to put you somewhere else at the drop of a hat.\r\n6) You cannot speak your mind. They preached candor and say they will not have any repercussions for speaking your mind, and yet.... I can think of many employees who have been let go, fired or basically threatened out the door for advocating for the staff or the integrity of the company. \r\n7) Service failure after service failure from the Executive team not understanding the time sensitive nature of the industry. They think nothing about pulling an entire department away for a 90 minute meeting. But then they'll blame it on the employees when customers get upset. \r\n\r\nI could go on and on, but I'm hoping you get the gist of it by now. Oh, and Graham, I wouldn't bother responding to this review, the people who have/do work for you know the truth of what it's like to work at A &amp; A. Those that you somehow manage to hire, will find out on their own what A &amp; A is like pretty darn quick!",

                        "response_text": "Hello, and thank you for this review.\n\nWhen a company is in an industry that has been slow to change and is moving away from doing things the way they’ve always been done, there is going to be some discomfort. \nI’m glad to hear that you think that the front line people are amazing - I agree! A &amp; A is spending a lot of time and effort getting the right people who demonstrate our core values on our team and to see those efforts are being recognized is very gratifying. After all, a great workplace is amazing co-workers!\n\nYes, I do consider myself privileged - to be able to work with such a great group of people who are constantly learning and growing.\n\nI’m not perfect, but I think we’re doing very well - we have 23 employees that have been with us for more than 10 years, and 12 that have been with us for more than 20 years! We celebrate 40 years in business this year, and our top customers send us referral letters and testimonials all the time. \n\nI/we like to hire people without industry experience because they offer a fresh/new/different perspective that challenges us and pushes us into different thinking. After all, we have amazing people who are certified customs brokers and we use their brains and expertise when it comes to the technical aspects of our business.\n\nWe can’t remove negative reviews from Glassdoor. If you google ‘I'm an employer. What can I do about negative reviews on Glassdoor?’ - they show that you can’t do anything about that, so the idea that we can remove negative reviews is not true. You also can’t delete or remove negative reviews on Google, etc. However, if there is a dispute and we resolve the issue with a customer, the customer can go back and edit their review if they are satisfied. As you’ve said, we believe in radical candor and we look forward to talking about any reviews we get - good or bad.\n\nI don’t agree that we pay below industry standards. There are 300 customs broker companies in Canada and thousands in the USA, including 5-10 competitors right across the parking lot from us in Canada and the USA. If we paid below industry standards, there would be an exodus to our competitors. In fact, we’ve given dozens of raises over the past year, and, yes, we give them to people who live and demonstrate our core values. One of the worst things a company can do is pay poor performers the same as high performers. This is not fair to high performers. \n\nRegarding turnover, yes we’ve had some turnover. We track desired vs undesired turnover, and our undesired turnover is extremely low. If people demonstrate our core values and are a pleasure to be around, they will excel at A &amp; A. The numbers you are stating are not correct - if we hired 50 people and only 10% stayed - that would mean that only 5 people stayed and 45 turned over. This is not true. And I don’t know of anyone that has ‘walked out and just never came back’. On the contrary, we’ve had a number of people who have asked to come back to A &amp; A after pursuing other opportunities. With regards to overtime - overtime is optional at A &amp; A and we happily pay overtime if it is required. It’s against the law to not pay for overtime. If it feels like we’ve been hiring a lot lately - that’s because we have been - we know we’ve gotten busier, as well as people retiring, maternity leave, etc., and we want to make sure we have the people in place to be staffed appropriately. And please be sure to always take your lunch! At the Canadian office, we’ve created a nice lunchroom, new, large fridges, new microwaves, new tables, blender, egg cooker, toaster oven and more to make it a spot for you to enjoy your lunch. It’s also why we really bug you to never eat at your desk… Take a break, go for a walk, sit outside. Please don’t work through your lunch. \n\nYes, we encourage our people to learn and grow, take educational courses, many or most of which we reimburse you for. Anyone who takes and passes the CCS (Certified Customs Specialist) course is awarded a raise for getting this designation. We also promote the reading of our book of the quarter and we bring in professors and authors to learn from so we can continuously improve.  \n\nYou can speak your mind at A &amp; A - if you attend one of our monthly fireside chats or quarterly huddles, you will see people raising their hands and questioning and challenging things here and we love this feedback. We also survey our people after every fireside and quarterly update and the feedback and ratings continue to improve.\n\nOf course, we make mistakes and we handle them with enthusiasm and making it right with the customer. I have an example of just last week where we made a mistake - but after it was done we received a GLOWING review from the customer and how A &amp; A always builds confidence with them and they even included the word WOW in their email to us. We handle thousands of transactions per week - let’s say for round numbers if we handled 10,000 shipments per month and we did 99% of them correctly, we would still have 100 mistakes per month. Our error rate and complaints are something we track and it is currently less than 1% error rate, something our people should be proud of.\n\nYes, every person is in one 90 minute meeting per week where we can IDS - Identify, Discuss and Solve issues that come up. This is your chance to speak up and identify issues so we can solve them. At A &amp; A, we believe that we can solve ANY issue. We can’t solve EVERY issue, though - so we have to prioritize, and chip away at issues. We find the happiest people at A &amp; A are the people who really participate in their weekly meeting, speak up and stand up for their issues until they are solved. It’s an amazing feeling to be getting hundreds of items solved and improved every week. \n\nI love reading and responding to these reviews, and I will continue to personally respond to each one and not delegate it to someone else in the company - because I care deeply about our reputation, I care about learning how we can improve and while I don’t agree with everything you’ve said here, you are right about some things and I always learn from this feedback.  \n\nI know our company isn’t for everybody, and it shouldn’t be for everybody. That annoys some people. It annoys the people that do not align with our core values. And that’s exactly what we want - we want a fun, encouraging, learning environment for people who live our core values. \n\nI’m glad you’ve found a new home and I hope you’re thriving in your new role.\nGB",

CEO is incompetent when it comes to running a company. He gets a few ideas from books he reads, people he talks to, podcasts, and his time at \"Harvard\" and then tries to apply them to the business. In theory this sounds great, but he tries to shove ideas down the companies'throat which in practice, dont apply. Seems like he doesn't fully understand or comprehend them but tries to make it work anyways. Every quarter is the same story: he gets a new idea, tries to make it stick, doesn't work, and the others are left cleaning up his mess. Also, most of these reviews here are posted by either people here less than a year, who have yet to get over their honeymoon period or either from people who HR had previously approached to post reviews which they can pretty much guess who wrote them, essentially nulling the \"anonymous\" aspect.

And we know and hope these people will find a great fit in the future! While we don’t love that there is some turnover, we are getting better and better at hiring for our core values fit. \r\n\r\nNow, when we hire, we talk to people about our core values. We talk to them about Learn and Grow and that you will be expected to help the company set goals, you will be expected to help us achieve them. You will be expected to read books and learn and grow. And when you do those things, you will be rewarded financially, you will be rewarded with more responsibility. People who don’t help us do those things, they realize they are not a fit and we both know it’s time to move on.\r\n\r\nI normally answer each specific point in these reviews, but the last 3-4 reviews have been pretty much the same theme, so I thought I would do a broader response to what’s happening inside A &amp; A and why we are seeing some turnover now.\r\n\r\nHere are the major changes that occurred with our company in 2014:\r\n\r\n1) We started to share our Vision and Goals with the entire company.\r\n2) We started to hire, promote, and terminate by our core values.\r\n3) Every year we set new company goals\r\n4) Every quarter we set new goals to reach those yearly company goals\r\n5) And, in this last quarter, we asked every single person in the company to set a goal to help us reach our quarterly goals, which will help us reach our yearly goals.\r\nWe do the above EVERY. SINGLE. QUARTER.\r\n\r\nFor people that fit our core values - they LOVE this involvement and are thinking of great goals and then crushing them every quarter. They understand goal setting, they understand continuous improvement.\r\n\r\nWhat are the results of this? We are growing. We are more profitable. We are bringing on new customers from larger competitors. We are promoting people. We are hiring. We are giving rewards and raises to people who are crushing their goals and living our culture and core values - and our culture is as strong as it’s ever been.\r\n\r\nWe still have a ways to go, we’re not perfect, we’re always learning.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nGB",

The reason for this is that we always look very strategically at replacing any position to make sure that we are looking at it in a current and future state. In other words, if someone who has been with us for 5 or 10 years leaves, times have changed, technology has changed, and we don't just replace the position without taking a hard look at what we need today and what we will need in the future.\r\n\r\nWe haven't done any downsizing recently, and when we do unfortunately have to let some people go, we try to do that on the same day rather than having one go here, another go there, etc., because it can be disturbing to the rest of the company.\r\n\r\nWe always tell our Manager that our people should never be surprised that we've had to go in different directions because a great manager will have had multiple conversations with our people before deciding that we are no longer a fit for each other. So there should be no wondering if you will have a job to go to because you will have had multiple conversations with your manager. Parting ways with someone is the last thing we want to do - it's very difficult on the person leaving and on the people remaining. However, we hold our core values very steady and if someone is talked to multiple times about which core value(s) they are violating, and they do not learn and grow, they do not make it happen, then we are left with helping that person find a company where they can be successful. We are always happy to see someone who was not a fit at A &amp; A go on to have a successful next chapter in their career. It may be difficult to believe, but we truly want to see that person go on to a better place and be happy.\r\n\r\nYou're right, we no longer allow people who have been let go to say goodbye to coworkers. I have to admit that I still struggle with this one. When I've had to let someone go myself, I used to let them go gather their things, go say goodbye to their friends, clean out their desk, etc., because I felt that was the civilized way to do it. However, we've been advised that this is not the healthiest way to do it...in one case a couple years ago, the person was still at their desk half an hour later. This can be very emotional for them and the people that remain. Now, if we have to make that difficult decision, we let them know it's best if they go now and we will gather their things and follow up. The good news is that we still care about these people and we've seen many instances where there are get-togethers, drinks, dinners, lunches, etc., with the people who have left and their friends at A &amp; A. We appreciate seeing this. In a few cases recently,  senior management has also taken people out for lunch because one of our core values is Serve with Enthusiasm - and we mean that all the way through their experience with A &amp; A.\r\n\r\nRegarding profit before employees, we do agree that a company needs to be profitable first and foremost - otherwise the company and the people are in danger. However we feel that profit comes from happy, engaged employees. We spend a lot of effort on adding things to improve our people's lives. You can see some of our many benefits here: https://www.aacb.com/best-place-work/   As you said in the beginning, we have great benefits and we are only able to do that because we have the best people in the industry! We want to be the best place to work, we are not perfect, but we are always striving to be better. \r\n\r\nThank you and best wishes on your next chapter!\r\nGB",

We're recruiting awesome people (as you've said), and we track our undesired turnover, which is people who we would not want to leave and who we would enthusiastically hire back, and that number is still 0 for the year. This means that anyone that has left our company in the last year has been a good decision for them and for us. And, we are achieving our goals and growing on both sides of the border which means our leadership team is effective at executing. \r\n\r\nRegarding deleting negative reviews - that's not true and it's also not possible for us to do that. In fact, Glassdoor has a procedure where an employer CAN flag a review to be removed if they think it's fraudulent, but we've never done that. We still do have negative reviews here - we know not everyone will always be happy with us. We did notice that some of our negative reviews were removed. When this happened, we asked Glassdoor about it to see what happened, and they let us know when or how they remove reviews but did not provide specifics. (See email chain from Glassdoor below.. *UPDATE OCT 22, 2018 - My response has been deleted twice from Glassdoor, by Glassdoor, because, I believe, I was including their email... So I will no longer include their email to avoid being deleted) \r\n\r\nRegarding me having no education - you're sort of right... :-) \r\nI've spent time at Kwantlen University, SFU Business School, UBC Sauder, Harvard Business School (twice) and London Business School. I'm a member of YPO which bills itself as \"The premier leadership organization of chief executives in the world. YPO is the global platform for chief executives to engage, learn and grow. YPO members harness the knowledge, influence and trust of the world’s most influential and innovative business leaders to inspire business, personal, family and community impact. Today, YPO empowers more than 25,000 members in more than 130 countries, diversified among industries and types of businesses. Altogether, YPO member-run companies employ 16 million people and generate USD6 trillion in annual revenues.\" I also read Audiobooks and Podcasts on a weekly and sometimes daily basis. \r\nBUT, I have no degree, MBA or any other certification (Except I am a Licenced Customs Broker) - and if I look back on what I knew 5 years ago vs what I know today, I sure feel stupid 5 years ago! I would call myself a lifelong learner. Continuously trying to get better, never finished. \r\n\r\nOperations are drowning because we are growing and we've identified this as a goal for this quarter and we are hiring as fast as we can but also slow enough to get the right (awesome) people! We've hired about 10 people in Operations in the last 40 days and still have more work to do here. \r\nThis is a good problem to have as a business - but we need to make sure we get the right resources so our people can make sure we deliver on our awesome customer service. \r\n\r\nI'm glad you've decided to find a new home and I hope you flourish wherever you land. You spend more time at work than you do with your family or friends and I'm a big believer that you should be extremely happy at work. Life is too short! \r\nBest wishes. \r\nGB",

                "review_pros": "I provide staff to healthcare facilities across the country. My heart feels good knowing this alone, the money is just a plus (to me) and there is money to be made.  Being an Account Manager DEFINITELY has its benefits (not including health insurance which we have).  I never thought that I would have a career like this. Growing up, I’ve always known three things. I am different. I want to help people with whatever I do. I want to be a Doctor. However, when I was born, there was a plaque with my name that said “Future career- Business Management”. I always thought those kind of people were snobby and don’t know what it’s like and I’m going to be different. So, I went to school for Biology (Pre-Med). Almost finished, there is only 1 year of credits left but student loans have killed those chances. In 2016, after working MULTIPLE odd jobs,  and not finding a place that was energized enough in my opinion, I had enough. I decided it was time to go school again but another one without loans. So, I looked up and found a school that had a nursing program where I was. I figured this will get me back on track to being a Doctor. After finishing the entrance exam the Academic Advisor at the time called me in and went over the results. He asked me if I preferred “Healthcare Administration”(HA). I said “No, I want Nursing”.  He told me I would do better in that field but, again I refused. He then asked me to try a few courses first. Apparently it was really important I get into the HA program so I finally agreed. The first few courses were ok so I decided to stay plus I didn’t feel like changing and taking more courses so fate had a hand in this one. 2.3 years later And I had the degree but now what? I no longer wanted to be a Doctor at this point because going through school I also tried to be a CNA. I finished the 6 week course and even worked in a facility for a few shifts. However, fate came in again and for some reason I couldn’t pass the state test practical (I passed written). Luckily, the school set me up with a job at a Home Healthcare Company a month before finishing. It was the Administrative assistant position. I obviously took it without knowing full scope because it was a job right out of college; do you know how rare that is statistically?! Little did I know what the job entailed until my first day. I’m bombarded with scheduling the visits for the physical, occupational, and speech therapist (about 20 total). Contacting the nearby hospitals for Intake of new patients (around 75-100 at the time). HR duties including hiring paperwork, credentialing, and maintaining the JHACO certification for the company (we passed in 2019). Payroll duties such as making sure the therapists turn in their notes on time so I can approve the visit and bring the numbers and the payments from the patients insurance companies to our accountant.  I spent over a year doing this with one other person at any given time (they kept quitting), and loved it, why because that’s exactly the kind of job I wanted. I can never stay still so I needed a place that is constantly moving and I can help people.  The boss was, let’s just say hard to work with but she had a dream and I believed in her. She worked hard seeing the patients and I enjoyed when she came back to the office and told me the experience. I learned a lot from that place and I would probably still be there if it wasn’t for unforeseen circumstances. Two weeks later, I was working for All American. Almost the same thing but this time I have help. I thought I could do it all and I still can but, I don’t have to here. Furthermore, the sky is the limit here (bonuses) and we have a voice as to the future of this company. All American has taught me that you can go far alone but, even further with the right team.",

This company for people who like to do a lot of different things at once. The ones who can’t sit still knowing that they have something to do because time is short. I would describe it as the “Pursuit of Happiness”. If you don’t like to grow and do better then this isn’t the place for you.  We are constantly growing and soon we will be in every state in the US. I look forward to that day and remember where we came from because we’ve come so far already. We aren’t perfect no and we don’t expect you to be but what we do need is people with Drive and Ambition to get better each time. If this isn’t you, I wish you nothing but the best of luck.",

Pros are that most directors/managers will work with your schedule if possible. The overall culture is desirable, however, my unit in particular has low morale, and always has due to a continued increase in demands, and a steady decrease in resources. I have seen many, many colleagues leave and go to other areas of the hospital, so the hospital in general is an OK place to work.",

The hospital has continuously decreased leave accumulation (CLB), as well as differentials. However, I'm sure that this sort of thing is common amongst area hospitals. If I was a nurse seeking new employment, I would likely select a different hospital because some nursing floors have done away with nursing assistants (PCTs). Such units include high acuity units, where you may only have 2-3 patients, but they are total care patients who may be upwards of 350+ pounds, and have a lot of needs. Many nurses are experiencing back pain. Management will say \"but you have ceiling lifts.\" True, but how do you visualize the patients posterior skin? Nurses are reliant on neighbor nurses in a poorly constructed floor plan, and it is not uncommon for you and/or your neighbor nurses to have high acuity assignments of their own. I have never seen or heard of a hospital eliminating an entire discipline, risking both patient and staff safety for the sake of budget.  It is a complete divergence from evidence based practice. However, the hospital hired several physicians and nurse practitioners on this particular floor. It's wonderful that medical staff is being increased, but who is going to bathe the patients, turn the patients, take vitals, draw labs, transport the patients to testing, and more? The support staff of course, and the hospital has eliminated many. If you are considering employment on a floor such as the one described, please know that you will be dietary, housekeeping, stocking staff, as well as be expected to care for high acuity patients. It should also be known that this hospital has MAGNET status, and primarily hires BSN prepared nurses.",

They now are even dictating where employees should park with no regard to which part of the building they work in or safety of the staff!! They expected us to cater to the pts like its a 5 star hotel while making us work understaffed and over worked. Each unit makes up their own holiday policies and procedures for the most part. So if they need you to work a certain holiday, theres no importance given to your seniority. This used to be an great hospital to work at but since they are placing priority on money and not the wellbeing of their staff and patients, it all gone down hill. Every unit I have been on there are staff crying, angry, feeling unappreciated and looking for jobs elsewhere.  I even spoke to the current CNO about safe patient to nurse ratios and she basically said that in the end it was a business and that we were nationally meeting our safety goals. I was floored because she said this in front of a lot of staff members who felt the same way I did. Point is, when your no longer at the bedside and raking in all the money, you tend to forget those that are in the trenches making you that money!! When they place the emphasis back on patient centered care and the wellbeing of those at the beside day after day, maybe they'll stop having such a high turn over rate. Having worked on different units while there, I saw over 25+ employees leave in less than 2 years. Thats a major red flag.",

We offer these choices because we believe that one medical plan does not fit everyone’s needs and that employees should be able to pick what works best for them. Another way we work to keep the benefit costs down is by having a tiered benefit structure, where our leadership and physicians pay a higher percentage of the premium costs to offset the premiums paid by employees.\r\n\r\nAs an organization we encourage employees’ growth through training and additional education. In order to provide tuition reimbursement to as many of our full-time and part-time employees as possible, we had to set this annual maximum. In addition to tuition reimbursement, AAMC has many scholarship programs which eligible employees are able to apply to.\r\n\r\nIf you have concerns about the collaboration between departments, we encourage you to speak to your supervisor.",

A decade ago the hospital was much smaller, but it's grown extremely fast.  It used to be a family of sorts where everyone knew each other, but that doesn't scale well.  Unfortunately, almost everything is accomplished, now, in a back room through this network of relationships, contrary to what stated policy is.  Staff, especially clinical, have been almost exclusively promoted into management despite lack of qualification as the hospital has grown; the result has been massive cost overuns and high turnover.  Turnover in my group (non-clinical) was in excess of 300% a year for over 3 years.  Expectations are not followed through on, promises are not kept, because the hospital does not move cohesively.  A large part of the hospital's success of late is their very committed (and wealthy) donor base; the hospital itself is doing very poorly.",

They now are even dictating where employees should park with no regard to which part of the building they work in or safety of the staff!! They expected us to cater to the pts like its a 5 star hotel while making us work understaffed and over worked. Each unit makes up their own holiday policies and procedures for the most part. So if they need you to work a certain holiday, theres no importance given to your seniority. This used to be an great hospital to work at but since they are placing priority on money and not the wellbeing of their staff and patients, it all gone down hill. Every unit I have been on there are staff crying, angry, feeling unappreciated and looking for jobs elsewhere.  I even spoke to the current CNO about safe patient to nurse ratios and she basically said that in the end it was a business and that we were nationally meeting our safety goals. I was floored because she said this in front of a lot of staff members who felt the same way I did. Point is, when your no longer at the bedside and raking in all the money, you tend to forget those that are in the trenches making you that money!! When they place the emphasis back on patient centered care and the wellbeing of those at the beside day after day, maybe they'll stop having such a high turn over rate. Having worked on different units while there, I saw over 25+ employees leave in less than 2 years. Thats a major red flag.",

                "review_cons": "Unfortunately in the time I've been at AAHA, history has negatively repeated itself like clockwork despite a new CEO, many executive-level shakeups, and board members having to show up to the office for a \"come to Jesus\" culture meeting after roughly half the staff left in a six month period due to internal negligence. In many ways, I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with AAHA.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the CEO Garth Jordan is making decisions to cut, introduce, or change programs and initiatives without fully understanding the context, consequences, or all the roles associated with them. Teams have been consolidated into one without clear direction, new job descriptions, or even an understanding of what each person previously did. It's up to us to pick up the pieces along the way. It feels like there's a new, intensely high priority, project introduced every other week with an impossible deadline attached to it. Employees are expected to manage these half-baked ideas on top of insane workloads and often serving on several extracurricular, ineffective \"core teams\".\r\n\r\nThese projects are often presented as \"fun, blue skies experiments\" where we can \"be creative and playful\". In reality, we're trying to execute someone else's misguided vision with vague or no direction, and circumvent challenges that should have been considered before committing to the project. When we ask \"why?\" in an attempt to understand the project, we either don't get a full, compelling answer or we're scolded and treated as \"problem employees\" (or both). \r\n\r\nI think many within leadership are acting out of fear of the board and CEO Garth Jordan. Based on the hostile meetings and micro aggressions I've witnessed, I can't blame them. I understand with any new leadership change there will be growing pains and as an employee I won't agree with every decision made. Gaslighting, intimidation, and ignoring employee concerns, however, is not okay.\r\n\r\nMany of us are suffering in silence right now, forced to rely on each other instead of leadership. We were told for months we'd have an anonymous follow-up culture survey distributed in March. Then, in the March all-staff meeting, it was announced this would not be happening and we'd be moving it to the summer instead. Now, we have to wait to have our collective voices heard. It seems AAHA is more interested in giving the CEO more time to fulfill his vision than make room to listen for potential warning signs. \r\n\r\nMost of us are introverts who do not feel comfortable voicing our concerns to our leaders publicly. Some of us don't trust our managers. Garth hosts open office hours but I've already been reviewed negatively by my manager for disagreeing with him in an open forum. If I had the opportunity to take that anonymous culture survey in March, I probably wouldn't even be writing this review. But under the fake smiles and excitement for \"a new start\", AAHA is breaking employees's spirits at an alarming rate.\r\n\r\nFor those interested, it's worth noting that AAHA's \"commitment\" to diversity, equity, and inclusion is entirely performative lip service bogged down by the gluttonous weight of complacency. With so much time, effort, and money being wasted on dozens of competing priorities, it's very telling that the things that actually matter are being left to get lost in red tape.",

If you are thinking about working here make sure you read through their magazine. Understand that this is a pro-Trump organization-“allegedly,” so be sure you read the website carefully. Aside from the politics, the office lacks structure/control, meaning the employees are over worked and under paid – “allegedly”. \"Fast paced\" really means, you are about to work more hours than you want, and if you don't, be prepared to play catch up and get burned out “allegedly”. A lot of the employees are cool and fun to talk to, but there are a select few who seem to be just putting on to save face. I experienced pompous and snooty attitudes from a select few. Bottom line is, only work here if you are desperate. Everything is very calculated and shady – “allegedly.” ^ My opinion^ Just saying! Good Luck!",

From the first day I worked here I suffered, I worked from 9 am to 11 pm, the manager assigned a lot of tasks everyday and checked them out suddenly, when he found anyone of these many tasks hasn’t been completed, he will criticize and abuse you fiercely. So engineers had started to learn and delayed every projects and they don’t care for the abuse anymore. The manager parachuted in from Shanghai wants everyone to do overtime, only Americans can say no. Asian engineers in the production department have to work 12-16 hours/day and they are forced to work full day long on Saturdays and sometimes on Sundays. Considering the low wages the company pays for an engineer, the hourly wage is much lower than the technicians’.(less than $13/h). Not to mention the manager just have the credit and took no responsibility for any decisions, he himself wants engineers to make final decisions, if bad things happen, he takes no responsibility at all.  What’s worse, the HR leaks the bad reviews to the manager. Everyday is a torture here. God bless my poor colleagues find better jobs.",

In this company, managers show no respect to engineers and technicians, they think they are GODs, workers are underclass, they mercifully grant workers some small money to buy food and workers should work for managers’s promotion and stocks until death. PTO are seldom allowed, “ Only we diligent managers have the right to have PTO, all of you sitting here do not have the right to have PTO!” The senior manager said this in the morning meeting to the engineers in public. Managers only care about their own credits, none of them matters lives of others. Tons of position offers were sent to candidates during the past few months, not a single one came to work in the end. Managers tried every trick to cheat candidates into coming to work for the company, but failed all the time. It’s not even a good choice for people who needs a working visa. The company doesn’t do a working visa application process for employees who starts his or her first day from January to March, you have to work for the company for many months before April. Some new hires waste almost a year waiting for the company to start their H1B working visa application. Unfortunately, according to the last H1B lottery results, ZERO of the six Chinese employees won, the attorney of this company told that all of them failed in lottery. It’s total a waste of time to work for this company because it can give you nothing but a greedy manager, a bullying environment, a 60 hours plus working hour per week, an extremely low pay wage, no promotion opportunity, almost no PTO allowed, no 401K match, heavily increasing workload month by month, a so-called “ competitive environment “ set up by the senior manager in which co workers hate and bad mouth each other......",

Someone got a promotion on the title but nothing in terms of salary.  There is a joke inside the company, \"Fulltime job, parttime salary\"\r\n\r\nWhen economy was down, the company cut 10% of the salary for all engineers and above and asked their employees to work 2 hrs overtime in force without paying any extra even if there was actually no work out there. So people ended up sitting in front of their computers, doing nothing but staring at their monitors. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, they laid off 50% of the people and when they rehired some of them back, they only gave 70% of their prior salary. Company also tried to save cost by cutting benefits, not only the deductable is now incredibly higher, but employees even had to pay for their own insurance. If you have family with two kids, you need to pay at least 600 USD a month for the insurance. \r\n\r\nCompany has very serious discriminations against people who don't speak and read English very well. If you are not good at English, company won't go with a standard procedure to make you pass probation simply because they don't want to give you a raise at all. However, for those who were born here or know how to complain, it will a totally different story. \r\n \r\nThe workload is heavy and very stressful to meet the deadline. On average, an engineer needs to stay one more hour everyday and sometimes work on the weekend as well, of course, without anything extra. But, no matter how hard you worked, how many contributions you made, you won't get any bonus, nothing, not a penny.\r\n\r\nI've already got out of this ugly place whereas I am sorry for my friends who still work there, especially those who were treated unfairly.

Instead of promoting knowledgeable people from within, loud mouths with no industry experience were brought in. They never listen to their employees and constantly state \"This worked at my last company, so this is how we'll do it.\" When the ideas inevitably fail, the managers throw whoever they can under the bus and never accept accountability for their poor decisions. The lack of knowledge of AAON products and refrigeration among the managers is insulting. THIS IS A CULTURE WHERE KNOWLEDGE DOESN'T MATTER.\r\n\r\nMany departments are arranged very poorly. One is team is being managed by someone who has a job function completely unreleated to what his subordinates do. Certain departments are filled with underqualified personnel or have poor leadership.

No one should EVER be appointed a manager in an HVAC manufacturing facility that doesn't have HVAC experiece.\r\n\r\nCreate a culture of positivity instead of one of fear. The 90% turnover rate is due to people's dissatisfaction with their supervisors and managers ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY. Upper management needs to recognize this and hold their managers accountable. Employees at every level are told they will be replaced if they do not perform. This creates a culture of fear, and it clearly is not working.

AAON refused to pay his medical bills, stating that motorcycle riding fell under \"risky behavior.\" Another woman in accounting was diagnosed with cancer and went to the hospital for treatment. The company was fast to put her on Long Term Leave (non-paid time off). Everyone's insurance payments come out of their paychecks, so when she did not pay her premiums, AAON dropped her quick. She died in the hospital.\r\n\r\nAAON's attitude towards employees is not just towards hourly employees, but extends to salaried positions, too.  The Production Manager busted his tail up there, but he was let go when a new product line did not start production when the new Company President wanted.

And he’s continued to send these messages and we know we’ll hear things before they’re put in place – the openness in communication at AAOS makes me feel calmer.  In a year where many people lost their jobs, we got to add teammates and add new benefits, even in the middle of a pandemic.  We pulled together as a team and worked really hard to do what we needed to do and that makes me proud.  We found ways to stay connected, have fun and learn more about each other.

Yes, because we have to be fiscally sustainable in order to do our best for our members.  Our values are sound; our practices are sound.  Staff is valuable and valued.  I believe that some of the individuals having the biggest issues are those who have never worked for another organization and have no perspective or context about some of the things AAOS has had to and is trying to do to remain the viable business we are.

Unfortunately, the promises of transparency and communication have not been honored. Yes, there are all-employee meetings, but the rumor mill has made these a laughing stock. Upper management may report to the directors, etc. what their plans are, but in many cases, this information doesn’t get disseminated.\r\n\r\n3. Management says work-life balance but it not a reality (except perhaps for themselves). Depending on your area, you will have un-realistic deadlines, too much work on your plate, or will simply need to get your work done as you were in meetings or training sessions (including mandated HR sessions).\r\n\r\n4. The restructuring has led to a lot of long-term employees being let go. Which has caused a lot of uncertainty and the feeling that knowledge, experience, and connections are not valued AND resentment when newer employees are favored or glorified. However, long-term employees also often don’t appreciate the fresh perspective that newer employees have.\r\n\r\n5. Some of the new management doesn’t know how to be managers or don’t even know what their area does. This lack of knowledge has led to some employees appearing to be favorites who don’t do their job while others who work hard are not acknowledged.\r\n\r\n6.

Perhaps an email every other week or some other mass form of communication that isn’t dependent on each level below you to disseminate the information or upcoming changes.

We have moved from running at a million dollar plus annual operating loss to generating a small surplus of reserves. This necessitated restructuring and outsourcing of certain teams &amp; roles that was painful. It's never easy to see people let go. \r\n\r\nThe organization is moving towards transparency, there is still a ways to go. We receive consistent messaging at our All-Staff meetings around the priorities that we're working on: culture, strategy, and governance. Our CEO offers an open floor for questions from any employee at each all-staff meeting. The new strategic plan attempts to connect the work of each department to the overall strategic goals of the Academy.

We need to continue to work on a shared vocabulary and embrace a shared vision. There are a lot of meetings where people seem to just talk past each other and it's borderline impossible to get people pulling in the same direction that way. \r\n\r\nSalary ranges are reasonable, but often not top-of-the-market for Chicago (even for association work).",

I don’t want to argue about the cadre of excellent people who gave a shitt but ended up marginalized after multiple wacky reorgs. I didn’t come here to discuss the strategic shortcomings of a management team that claims to have improved transparency while barring staff from board meetings and distributing all bad news through subordinates.\r\n\r\nAnd far be it from me to suggest that a membership organization has a responsibility to address the needs of its members. That’s nonsense. No one believes that. It's 2018, not 2008.\r\n\r\nI left and I’m happy, thank you. My friends who remain in the Rosemont building are frustrated and depressed, but the smartest of them will land on their feet elsewhere. Quite a few already have. I have no ax to grind.\r\n\r\nExcept one…\r\n\r\nThe sexual harassment has got to stop. Now. I’m looking at you, upper management. It’s never acceptable, whether it takes place in a hallway or in an elevator or behind closed doors. It’s immensely stupid if it’s one of the first two, but perhaps that’s part of the transparency initiative. I don’t know. I do know that HR has been contacted on more than one occasion, but so far they seem to refuse to move on it. I have to wonder what their endgame is, because if the company gets sued, someone is probably going to ask why important people knew about it but never responded. One must admire the loyalty of the HR team, if not their decision making skills.\r\n\r\nWork at the AAOS if you must. The benefits are decent and they pay the salaries on time.

                        "response_text": "I have not yet responded to any posts here because I know perception is reality and disproving a negative is impossible. That said, I am responding to this post because the  assertions are not supported by facts, are insulting to all Academy staff and reflect a particularly toxic, reckless brand of feedback.   \r\n\r\nI am very aware that the level of necessary change and transformation implemented since I joined the Academy has been significant and unprecedented. I am equally aware that these actions have upset the status quo, including reorganizations which resulted in layoffs and outsourcing. These changes have been unwelcome for some and celebrated by others. \r\n\r\nEvery action taken was implemented after careful thought, for specific reasons and to make the Academy sustainable and successful into the future. As the CEO, it is one of my responsibilities to  ensure that we operate in a way that provides optimal member value. \r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we have dedicated a lot of focus to reassessing our strategic plan, applying discipline and metrics to execute on the current strategy, building a performance-based culture and undergoing a Board-led governance review. Many are finding an abundance of opportunities for growth, innovation and improvement. My hope is that those unhappy with the changes would be professional and decide either to contribute positively to the changes or move on rather than stay.\r\n\r\nTurning to specific untruths made in the post, several employees have voiced strong disagreement with the negative reviews posted here. I have no concerns if someone suggested that those employees feel free to post their own experiences. But no one, at anyone's request, is soliciting positive reviews. \r\n\r\nDuring my fourteen-month tenure, I have been encouraged by the staff who have stepped-up to the challenges and, in a number of cases, earned well-deserved and often overdue promotions. It represents a win all around - for these employees and  the Academy. To say that those promotions were based on appearances or anything other than performance is insulting,  wrong, and mean spirited.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to continuing this trend and fully support the initiatives generated by the many talented AAOS employees. We are using new ways to encourage open and direct communication between staff  and AAOS leaders, including breakfasts with me and using other platforms to ask any question or provide feedback. As always, I welcome candid discussions.  I encourage staff to stop by and have a conversation with me - many do. You may not always agree with me, but we can have a respectful conversation.\r\n\r\nThe post also contains assertions about the environment and sexual harassment at the Academy.  I take these very seriously. The descriptions in the post are entirely incorrect and unfounded. From day one, I have stressed that the Academy will be a workplace where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. Harassment of any type is unacceptable and not tolerated. These are not just words and aspirations. We have an entire framework of policies and procedures to ensure a respectful and productive environment.   Wherever and whenever any such issues come to our attention, they are addressed promptly, thoroughly and professionally. \r\n\r\nAll staff are required to take regularly schedule anti-harassment training.  Our last training occurred in 2017; additional on-site training will be held in August. We have an ethics hotline which allows for anonymous reporting.  However, anyone who experiences or witnesses harassment or inappropriate behavior is strongly encouraged to report it to their manager or director, the Chief HR Officer or the General Counsel.  Every report  is thoroughly investigated until a final determination is made. One of HR’s roles in this process is to ensure freedom from any related retaliation for making a report. Retaliation will not be tolerated. The result of any investigation is a private matter between the Academy and the individuals directly involved. While we do not publicly share those outcomes, absolutely nothing is brushed under the carpet.  This is non-negotiable for me. \r\n\r\nGood luck in your new endeavors now that you have left the Academy. I think it was the right decision.\r\n\r\nIf you’re still reading, thanks for hanging in there with me.  For those thinking about working at the Academy, I  hope that you can weigh the difference between anonymous toxic assertions and making up your own mind based on due diligence and outreach. The Academy is an outstanding, mission-driven place to work. Our offices are filled with smart, talented, engaged and committed staff of all kinds. Everyone has an opportunity to make a positive impact.  We empower our employees to act, encourage innovation, support our staff in their professional growth and provide a pretty darn good and flexible work environment.   Thanks. TOM AREND",

There is no room for advancement with no hopes of change. \r\n\r\nEducation and Publications department are in ruin due to the last Chief Education Officer. Hopefully, with the new replacement things will get better. However, it's hard to repair years of damage which means more layoffs are possibly on the horizon.\r\n\r\nIT department is poorly structured and lack talent in many areas.\r\n\r\nMany individuals in leadership roles are either incompetent or lack experience with no idea how to manage or lead. It doesn't help that some leaders have very little to no personalities. Many have been here for years and have not current with the times.\r\n\r\nThings were not in the greatest shape with the previous CEO but when the new Sheriff and Deputy came aboard, they created a toxic environment that is now in a worse state than it was before a mass lay-off (over 30-people in one day). \r\n\r\nBetween those months before the layoff, the AAOS suffered poor morale and productivity in some departments because no one knew if their job was secure or not.  Till this day, the effects are still being felt. \r\n\r\nThere's a huge lack of transparency, no matter how much senior, executive, and c-level management will try to say otherwise. Your job can be safe one day, but you won't know what the future holds because everything is kept secret. \r\n\r\nI really hope that this place improves with new leadership, but I doubt it will. There are still some good people here, but everyone is looking elsewhere for a more stable working environment.\r\n\r\nI would wait years before ever considering a job at this place, with the hopes of new changes and leadership being in place.",

Some of the people in higher positions are mean, but are easily avoidable if you’re a layperson. \r\n\r\nIn my case, good work/life balance, but I know some staff who work well into the early morning and weekends. It apparently depends on your position.\r\n\r\nShower room with towels. Amazing staff in mail room—if you’re addicted to Amazon Prime or online shopping in general, this is a safe place to get all your shopping delivered.\r\n\r\nCasual attire.",

How about some of the staff cut their 5-figure bonuses?\r\n\r\n1-2% yearly “Merit Increases” for low-totem people is an insult.\r\n\r\nNice office, but located in Ghiradelli Square, which is difficult to get to if you don’t live in the immediate area. \r\n\r\nYou are required to work for a week at their annual meeting, which takes place in different cities. This requires lots of schmoozing, standing, walking, and wearing very ugly purple uniforms. You are fed cafeteria food, and sometimes it's not too bad. You will also be rewarded with a decent meal at a restaurant.

Also, time off is usually granted from Christmas through New Year’s, another nice perk.\r\n\r\nRecognition initiatives have been rolled out including Bonusly and spot bonuses.\r\n\r\nStaff (reduced rate) parking is reasonable (compared to other employers in the city)\r\n\r\nNew automated, secured bike cage and free bike rentals to get errands done in the city\r\n\r\nWeekly free fresh fruit delivery is made to the break rooms. Newly installed water bottle filling stations have been installed. \r\n\r\nA large Starbucks is on the first floor (one of the larger ones in California).  Cappuccino coffee machines are on each floor (if you don't want to pay for a Starbucks).\r\n\r\nEven free snacks for all can be found if you know where to find them (2nd floor: IT, 3rd floor: Education, and 4th floor: Meetings)\r\n\r\nIf you want more of a selection, the Academy installed an Avanti mini-market to allow the purchase of food and beverages at a reduced rate in the remodeled break room and a nice ping-pong table has appeared (even a catered annual table tennis tournament has started). Even all of the floor kitchens have been remodeled.\r\n\r\nGreat location allows for a nice run, jog, or stroll to Aquatic Park with nice views of the Golden Gate and Alcatraz and a new multi-purpose workout room for Pilates and yoga with writable walls was installed. After a good workout, there are multiple private showers with shampoo, soap, and free towel service.",
                "review_cons": "It doesn't have free daily lunches or dinners like Google or other technology companies: it's a non-profit that's been fiscally responsible to its Board with its members' dues. Even with the financial downturn in 2008-2009, it didn't have layoffs unlike other companies (public, private, or non-profit). Unlike a publicly traded company scrambling to make the quarterly numbers or a startup dealing with venture capitalists who can sell it out in a few years for a profit, the Academy has provided solid stability over its 120-year history (several friends have stated they were pleased to focus on the mission and give up the stress being bought out or the possibility of layoffs). \r\n\r\nComments about \"horrible\" managers and non-performers may be true to certain extent (All places have them. Let’s be real), but the environment is starting to change for the better where a number of these individuals have retired, been coached appropriately, or have left (finally).  A new leadership development initiative for a select group of managers was launched and recent leadership participants (alumni) have met to improve collaboration, understand leadership challenges, and break silos. A culture of respect for others is a strong part of the Academy environment: people who are passive-aggressive, loud-mouthed, incompetent, and/or lazy won't last long. \r\n\r\nThe Academy is not a large organization, so promotions may not be as fast, but recently a minor reorganization and a new mindset have allowed for internal and cross-divisional promotions at various levels ranging from individual contributors, middle management, and even executive management (AMS, Brand and Creative, Education, IT, Meetings, and Quality & Data Science come to mind).  \r\n\r\nLong hours can be an issue especially with employees who work in core mission areas, but management and HR allow for flexibility as needed.\r\n\r\nThough the location may be great when you get there, the commute can be a challenge for those who come across the Bay Bridge, though there are options to flex your work schedule.\r\n\r\nAgree with others that the dental plan could be better.",

If you get promoted one job grade, your pay raise is capped at 5 percent, no negotiation available. They supposedly benchmark salaries against industry every three years, but I had such an evaluation shortly after a promotion and they somehow concluded my new pay matched industry standards. It did NOT, according to my research on Salary.com, but when I asked for the data that supported their conclusion, they never responded. The Academy was a great place to work seven-plus years ago, but work-life balance can be pretty bad in some departments, with little to no recognition for sacrifice. After one huge, extremely demanding project I worked on, the core team got only the usual annual bonus for that year (less than one paycheck after taxes; bonuses depend on the fiscal-year outcome) and a worse-than-usual thank-you meal. After putting in about 130 hours' overtime toward the end of the project -- the most in my near-decade there, with multiple 12-hour days -- I got only two days of unofficial comp time and a fractionally higher annual merit increase. (I don't think our team had any larger a merit pool, despite the project; I think that was just how my manager chose to allocate it.) Probably related to these factors, 2015 brought unusually high turnover.",

                "review_advice": "Change the promotion-raise policy. A former HR employee I spoke to told me 10 percent raises seemed more fair. You clearly expect more than 5 percent more of someone who gets promoted. Why put them in a position of making a lower effective hourly rate? Also consider a better comp-time policy. People who have to work weekends or holidays should get a day-for-day substitution. I know of people who travel almost every weekend in January and hardly seem to get any time off that month. How can they possibly do their best work with no break? It would also be great if you offered a more meaningful bonus to people who make significant sacrifices for certain projects. I've heard executives talk about how the Academy rewards hard work, but that's not true. You don't -- and that's probably a big part of the recent high turnover. It's certainly destroyed most of my loyalty.",
